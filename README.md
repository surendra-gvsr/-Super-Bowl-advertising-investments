# Super-Bowl-advertising-investments

1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This analysis investigates the effectiveness of Super Bowl advertising investments in generating social media buzz for three car brands: Beetle, Camaro, and CR-Z. Using data collected across 15 weeks spanning pre and post-Super Bowl periods, we analyzed relationships between advertising spend and social media metrics including total mentions, positive sentiment, and negative sentiment. Our analysis reveals that while Beetle achieved the highest relative increase in social media engagement from its ad spending, Camaro maintained the highest absolute volume of social media mentions despite lower relative gains. The data contradicts the assumption that higher ad spend automatically generates proportional social media buzz, suggesting that content quality and brand positioning may play crucial roles alongside investment levels.

3. DATA ANALYSIS AND RESULTS

3.1. Factor Analysis

Advertising Spend Impact
Analysis revealed varying correlations between ad spend and engagement:
- Pre-Super Bowl correlation between ad spend and volume: 0.975
- Post-Super Bowl correlation between ad spend and volume: 0.0513
- Significant shift in correlation patterns after Super Bowl period

Brand Performance Analysis
The brand-specific analysis revealed:
- Beetle: Highest mean ad spend post-Super Bowl ($891,000)
- Camaro: Highest mean volume post-Super Bowl (93,613 mentions)
- CR-Z: Lowest engagement across all metrics

3.2. Statistical Analysis Results

Mean Engagement Changes
Beetle showed significant changes:
- 46.52% increase in positive mentions post-Super Bowl
- Mean volume increased from 3,418 to 4,319 mentions
- Strongest correlation between ad spend and engagement (0.478)

Camaro performance metrics:
- 9.68% increase in positive mentions post-Super Bowl
- Mean volume increased from 87,596 to 93,613 mentions
- Weaker correlation between ad spend and engagement (0.115)

4. RECOMMENDATIONS AND CONCLUSION

Based on our comprehensive analysis, we recommend the following actions:

1. Investment Strategy
   - Focus on content quality alongside spending levels
   - Consider brand-specific engagement patterns when allocating budgets
   - Develop targeted social media strategies for different brand positions

2. Brand-Specific Approaches
   - Beetle: Capitalize on demonstrated ability to convert ad spend to engagement
   - Camaro: Focus on maintaining high baseline engagement
   - CR-Z: Reevaluate marketing strategy and positioning

3. Measurement Framework
   - Implement real-time social media monitoring
   - Track sentiment changes more granularly
   - Establish clear ROI metrics for high-cost advertising

4. Future Planning
   - Develop integrated marketing strategies beyond Super Bowl
   - Create brand-specific engagement targets
   - Establish regular performance monitoring systems

The analysis demonstrates that Super Bowl advertising impact varies significantly by brand. While Beetle achieved the highest relative gains from its investment, Camaro maintained superior absolute engagement levels. This suggests that effective Super Bowl advertising requires a nuanced understanding of brand position and audience engagement patterns rather than simply maximizing ad spend. The weak post-Super Bowl correlations between spending and engagement indicate that other factors, such as creative content and brand reputation, play crucial roles in determining advertising effectiveness.
